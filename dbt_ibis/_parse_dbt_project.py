    Reason is that we want to prevent dbt from reusing the generated artifacts from
    an incomplete dbt parse command for subsequent commands as those
    artifacts are based on an incomplete dbt project (i.e. the missing compiled
    Ibis models). If, for example, an Ibis model is referenced in a .yml file but
    does not yet exist, dbt will disable the model in the manifest. Any subsequent
    dbt command might not recreate the manifest due to partial parsing.

    This can't be replaced by the global --no-write-json flag as dbt will then
    still write partial_parse.msgpack.
